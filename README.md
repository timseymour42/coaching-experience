# NBA Coaching Analysis: Investigating Experience's Effect on Winning

## Overview
In the 2023 NBA offseason, several playoff-contending teams fired their coaches and I became curious about what types of candidates they should pursue. Mike Budenholzer, Monty Williams, and Doc Rivers quickly became candidates for other highly-desirable positions
which led me to wonder if a first time head coach can produce better results; Will Hardy and Joe Mazzulla each had tremendous regular season success in their first seasons last year. This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that investigates the impact of coaching experience on winning percentages in the NBA. The dataset spans from the 2000 season to 2023, including statistics on regular-season wins, playoff wins, and other relevant information. This analysis aims to provide insights into how a coach's experience and performance in previous seasons affect their ability to lead their team to victory.
